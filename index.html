    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      The SBSO Foundation is committed to promoting fitness and outdoor sports among youth. To continue this vision, we are launching the Bengaluru Super Sports League (BSSL), a turf cricket tournament in T10 format, to be held in November.
      <br><br>
      BSSL will provide young players with the right platform to showcase their talent while engaging a large live audience. At the same time, it offers great opportunities for sponsors to advertise and reach a highly energetic and connected crowd. In the past, sponsors like The Souled Store have successfully partnered with us.
      <br><br>
      Our mission is simple—make the youth fit, active, and inspired through outdoor sports while creating value for our players, audiences, and partners.
